# University-Management-System

     My project is for management system for a university. And the project’s code is written in structured programming language(C programming). Here I used function, structure, file management and other functions and keywords to make the program user friendly. 
     
     Function of the project:
1. There are three kind of user: Admin, Course teacher and Student.
2. Login to the every type of user needs username and password.
    Everyone has unique username and password. No one can login
    without username and password. And if someone mistypes password
    and username three times in a row, program will return to the main
    window.
3. Functions of the users:
   Admin:
     (i)  Admin can add new students and edit their information. And
           after every semester admin can edit their course. 
    (ii)  Admin can add new teacher and gives them courses for taking
           class and also can edit these course.
   (iii)  Admin can search attendance, information of teacher, students,
           results and can see their password, if someone forget their
           password.
   (iv)  Admin can generate results after all course teachers added their
          course results. And delete previous data after completing the
          semester.

  Course teacher:
    (i)  Course teacher can see information of him/her and the
          information of any students and their results.
   (ii)  Course teacher can add results of his/her given courses.
   (iii) Course teacher can add and search attendance of the students of
         his/her courses.
   (iv)  Teacher can change his/her given password.

 Student:
  (i)  Student can see his own profile, results and money receipt.
 (ii)  Students can change his/her given password.

Advantages:
 The best advantage of this code is making the data of a university digitalized. The data can be added and searched by some clicks. It is time saving. Here chances of losing and time for searching data is less than writing information of any paper. Admin, teacher and student’s all tasks can be done by this code.

 Disadvantages:
1. The main problem is pressure of excessive data. To solve this
     problem, admin has to delete data of previous semester. Though the
    final result will be saved and it won’t be lost. But we can’t save the
    every course result of previous semester for excessive data load.
2. When the program asked to give integer number, it will make
     problem if you give character. Example: If you are asked to give
    choice for further task, you have to enter the number of the step. 
3. Admin need a list of course code for memorizing the code to write
    down for students and teachers and avoid making spelling mistakes.
4. It doesn’t have internet connection. So all works should be done by
    the same computer.
